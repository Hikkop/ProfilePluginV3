ProfilePluginV3
===============

The successor to ProfilePluginV2.

Currently in its extremely early state. I shall update the readme with more information soon.

Current State:

  - Initial plugin files are created, plugin runs on server startup and responds to commands.

Planned Features:

  - Use a SQL database for better data management
  - Provide a GUI for easier information access/creation
  - Allow users to optionally provide different information, such as Kik usernames etc

To Do:

  - Import SQLibrary using Maven (currently it can't find the jar in the specified repo)
  - Set up database system using SQLibrary
